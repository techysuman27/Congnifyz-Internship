## ðŸ“‚ **Tasks & Insights**
### ðŸ”¹ **Level 1: Basic Data Analysis**
âœ… **Top Cuisines Analysis:** Identified the three most common cuisines and their distribution.
âœ… **City-Wise Restaurant Trends:** Analyzed the city with the highest number of restaurants and its average ratings.
âœ… **Price Range Distribution:** Visualized how restaurants are categorized by price range.
âœ… **Online Delivery Impact:** Compared the ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.

### ðŸ”¹ **Level 2: Intermediate Analysis**
âœ… **Restaurant Ratings:** Analyzed the distribution of restaurant ratings and their voting patterns.
âœ… **Cuisine Combinations:** Identified the most frequent cuisine pairings and their effect on ratings.
âœ… **Geographic Analysis:** Mapped restaurant locations to find clustering patterns.
âœ… **Restaurant Chains:** Explored chains' popularity and their impact on customer preferences.

### ðŸ”¹ **Level 3: Advanced Data Insights**
âœ… **Restaurant Reviews:** Extracted sentiment insights from customer reviews.
âœ… **Votes Analysis:** Examined the correlation between number of votes and restaurant ratings.
âœ… **Price Range vs. Online Services:** Analyzed whether expensive restaurants are more likely to offer online delivery and table booking.
